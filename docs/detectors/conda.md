# Conda Detection

## Requirements

The lock file produced by `conda-lock` will be used. Accordingly the only requirement is that this file is present.

## Default Detection strategy

The detector will parse `conda-lock.json` and `*.conda-lock.json` files. The lock file contains a reference to the `environment.yml` file that was used to generate the lock file. The detector will try to parse the referenced environment.yml file as well.

The `environment.yml` file is parsed to determine which packages are directly referenced. Afterwards, starting from these packages the dependency tree will be build up. If the `environment.yml` file cannot be parsed (e.g., it is not present for some reason), all files in the conda-lock file will be considered directly referenced. This is done, to avoid that no alerts will be fired at all, if the `environment.yml` cannot be parsed. 

## Possible future improvements

If the `environment.yml` file cannot be parsed, the dependency graph can be build bottom up. That is, start with packages that donâ€™t have any other dependencies and traverse the tree bottom up. Finally, all packages that are not references by any other packages are considered directly referenced.
